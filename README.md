# Responsive Design (with The Next Web)

This project's aim is to clone [The Next Web](http://thenextweb.com/) home page, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced. The goal is to use CSS3 media queries to respond to different devices to optimize the display of the page for different browser widths.

This is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) HTML/CSS track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design?ref=lc-pb) for more information.
